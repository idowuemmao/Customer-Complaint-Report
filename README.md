### Data-Driven Insights into Consumer Financial Protection and Corporate Accountability

**Developed by:** *Emmanuel Idowu*
**Tool:** Microsoft Power BI | **Dataset Source:** Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

## üìò **Project Overview**

The **CFPB Complaints Analytics Dashboard** provides a comprehensive analysis of consumer complaints lodged with the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**.
It enables stakeholders to monitor **trends, product-level complaint patterns, response efficiency, and company performance** over time.

The dashboard was built to answer key questions such as:

* How have consumer complaints evolved across time and states?
* Which products and issues drive the most dissatisfaction?
* How do companies compare in responsiveness and accountability?

---

## üß† **Analytical Data Model**

The data model was designed using a **Star Schema** to optimize for performance, interactivity, and clarity.

### **Fact Table**

#### `FactComplaints`

Contains detailed complaint-level data with metrics such as:

* Complaint ID
* Date Received
* Company ID
* Product & Sub-Product
* Issue & Sub-Issue
* State & Census Region
* Timely Response Indicator
* Response Time (Days)
* Market Share %

### **Dimension Tables**
